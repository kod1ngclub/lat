# lat.css

"Line and text"

## Philosophy

- anti-colorful
- only 'shadow' color
- lightweight

## Getting Started

```bash
# install package
npm install -g sass

# clone git

cd lat

# build
sass --style=compressed index.scss build.min.css

echo "⛏️ build.min.css"
```

> I think this repo is too short to make some docs.
> Just read the whole code, and you will know it
